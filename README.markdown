# Canvas 360
There is no slider. Drag the image to rotate it.

# Example
There is an example file with clicks working on frame 35 (check the indicator in the top-left corner of the page for frame number). Just click *Choose file* and load it to see how it is.

# Recording click areas
Click start recoriding and select the clicking area for each marker.
To select an area drag from the top left corner of the area till the bottom right corner, then release the mouse.

Click *Reset Frame* to start recording again.

#Saving changes.
Once you have recorded the last frame (frame 35), a download button will appear at the end of the page. Download the file.
Now just the clicks will be live and you can load the file into the demo from the *Choose file* button.


# Changes
Once all clicks are recorded I can make it look nicer and remove this Recording functionality so that it is ready for the client to see.
